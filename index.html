            <h2>All About Viburnums</h2>
            <p>Viburnums have long been one of the most popular flowering landscape shrubs. There are over 150 species of Viburnum.
                You can find a variety to suit any garden need: wet or dry, sun or shade, natural or formal, shrub or tree, native or exotic, USDA Zones 2-9. Bloom times
                span early spring through June and are followed by attractive fruit and outstanding fall foliage.</p>
            <p>
                Viburnums are well behaved members of the honeysuckle family.
                They are either shrubs or trees.
                The tree forms may require some pruning to achieve the desired shape. 
                The U.S. National Arboretum has done extensive breeding for hardy, pest resistant varieties.</p>
            <p>
                Viburnums work great as hedges or in mass groupings and also make interesting specimen plants or anchors in borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most viburnums prefer full sun but will adjust to partial shade. 
                They like a moderately fertile soil with a pH between 5.6 - 6.6., although many do just fine in alkaline soils.
                In general, viburnums are not terrible particular about where they grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                That few pests will bother viburnums is one of the reasons they have become so popular in the landscape. 
                Recently the Viburnum Leaf Beetle (VLB) has been introduced into North America trough Canada and has begun making its way south.
